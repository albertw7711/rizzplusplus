It refers to the explicit agreement between all parties that would like to engage in a sexual act. Consent is like ordering food at a restaurant; just like how you wouldn&#8217;t expect someone to order for you without asking if that&#8217;s what you want, you shouldn&#8217;t assume someone is willing to participate in sexual activity without asking for their explicit consent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-uagb-advanced-heading uagb-block-7e2a9341\"><h2 class=\"uagb-heading-text\">When do I need to give consent?<\/h2><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Consent is an essential element of any healthy and safe sexual relationship, and it is a legal requirement in many jurisdictions. For example, in many states and countries, sexual activity without consent is considered sexual assault or rape and is punishable by imprisonment. Consent is getting a driver&#8217;s license; no consent, no sex.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-uagb-advanced-heading uagb-block-ab117fce\"><h2 class=\"uagb-heading-text\">Who needs to give consent?<\/h2><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Consent is a clear and enthusiastic agreement to participate in sexual activity. It is a voluntary choice that should not be influenced by coercion, threats, or force. For example, if someone threatens to break up with their partner unless they engage in sexual activity, that&#8217;s not considered consent because the decision was influenced by coercion. Similarly, consent obtained when the other party is not in a clear conscious state is not considered valid, such as when they are drunk.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-uagb-advanced-heading uagb-block-0d66572d\"><h2 class=\"uagb-heading-text\">How to give consent?<\/h2><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Consent must be given by all parties involved in the sexual encounter. It is not enough for one person to give consent on behalf of another. This means that both partners need to be actively involved in the discussion about sexual activities and be comfortable with the decisions made. Consenting is like signing a contract; just like how both parties need to agree and sign a contract to make it legally binding, both parties need to explicitly give consent to engage in sexual activity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consent should be given verbally and explicitly. It should not be assumed or implied. Non-verbal cues, such as body language or silence, cannot be considered consent. It is important to ask for consent and wait for a clear and enthusiastic response before engaging in any sexual activity. It is also important to be aware of the scope of the consent and the time during which it is valid. For example, being consented to having close physical contact does not mean being consented to engage in intercourse.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-uagb-advanced-heading uagb-block-ece5b1fc\"><h2 class=\"uagb-heading-text\">Examples of consent<\/h2><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Consent can be given in many ways, and it can vary from person to person. Here are some examples of how consent can be given:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Verbal: &#8220;Yes, I want to have sex with you.&#8221;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Non-verbal: A nod, a smile, or a positive response to a sexual advance.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Conditional: &#8220;I&#8217;m comfortable with this sexual activity, but I don&#8217;t want to do anything else.&#8221;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Revoking consent: &#8220;I&#8217;m not comfortable with this anymore. I want to stop.&#8221;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Enthusiastic: &#8220;Yes! I&#8217;ve been wanting to do this with you for a long time.&#8221;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-uagb-advanced-heading uagb-block-da554d6e\"><h2 class=\"uagb-heading-text\">Why is consent important?<\/h2><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Consent is essential for a safe and healthy sexual encounter. It is a fundamental human right that should be respected and upheld. Without consent, sexual encounters can become non-consensual, which can have severe physical and psychological consequences for all parties involved. Non-consensual sexual encounters are considered sexual assault or rape and are illegal in most jurisdictions. You have absolute right and ownership over your body. Just like your house, if you don\u2019t want a person to enter it, he\/she is not legally allowed to do so or it would be considered intrusion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-uagb-advanced-heading uagb-block-6a80ab44\"><h2 class=\"uagb-heading-text\">Conclusion<\/h2><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>In conclusion, sexual consent is a crucial element of any healthy and safe sexual relationship. It should be given explicitly, voluntarily, enthusiastically, and by all.
